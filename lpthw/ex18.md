# exercise
1. 输入代码
```python
# this one is like your script with argv
def print_two(*args):#函数名为print_two，多个参数的方式可以是*args
# That tells Python to take all the arguments to the function and then put them in args as a list.
    arg1, arg2 = args #因为使用*args
    print(f"arg1: {arg1}, arg2: {arg2}")

# ok, that *args is actually pointless, we can just do this
def print_two_again(arg1,arg2):#这里不用*args而是用arg1,arg2
    print(f"arg1: {arg1}, arg2: {arg2}")

# this just takes one arguement
def print_one(arg1):
    print(f"arg1: {arg1}")
#this one takes on arguement
def print_none():
    print("I got nothing")
print_two("Zed","Shaw")
print_two_again("Zed","Shaw")
print_one("First!")
print_none()
```
  - 函数可以做三件事
    - 以变量的名字命名一段代码
    - 以参数来控制输入
    - 这样你就可以制作自己的脚本
# study drills(函数创建与使用检查清单函数)
1. Create a function checklist for later exercises. Write these checks on an index card and keep it by you while you complete the rest of these exercises or until you feel you do not need the index card anymore
  - Did you start your function definition with def? -
  Does your function name have only characters and _ (underscore) characters? -  Did you put an open parenthesis ( right after the function name?
  - Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis ( separated by commas?
  - Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?
  - Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon ): after the arguments?
  - Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.
  -  Did you "end" your function by going back to writing with no indent (dedenting we call it)?
2. When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:
  - 1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
  - 2. Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
  - 3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
  - 4. Did you end the function call with a ) character?
