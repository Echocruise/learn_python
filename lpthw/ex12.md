1.In Terminal, where you normally run python3.6 to run your scripts, type pydoc input. Read what it says. If you’re on Windows try python3.6 -m pydoc input instead
>
Help on built-in function input in module builtins:
input(prompt=None, /)
    Read a string from standard input.  The trailing newline is stripped.  
    The prompt string, if given, is printed to standard output without a
    trailing newline before reading input.  
    If the user hits EOF (nix: Ctrl-D, Windows: Ctrl-Z+Return), raise EOFError.
>    On nix systems, readline is used if available.

2. Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit
3. Look online for what the pydoc command does.
  - Python documentation tool
4. Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It’s alright if you do not understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting things.
  - open
  - file
  - os
  - sys
