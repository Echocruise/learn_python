# exercise
1. 输入代码
```python
from sys import argv # 倒入argv模块

script, input_file =argv # 两个参数 ex20.py ex20.txt 定义参数

def print_all(f): # 定义函数 读取txt的内容
    print(f.read())

def rewind(f):
    f.seek(0)#file.seek是将文件游标移动到文件的任意位置，然后对文件的当前位置进行操作（增加、删除内容等）
    # help（f.seek）

def print_a_line(line_count, f):
    print(line_count, f.readline())#指定读取第几行的内容


current_file=open(input_file)# 打开 inputfile ex20.txt

print("First let's print the whole file:\n")

print_all(current_file)


print("Now let's rewind, kind of like a tape.")

rewind(current_file)

print("Let's print three lines:")

current_line= 1
print_a_line(current_line,current_file)
current_line= current_line +1
print_a_line(current_line,current_file)
current_line= current_line +1
print_a_line(current_line,current_file)

```

# study drills

1. Write English comments for each line to understand what that line does.

2. Each time print_a_line is run, you are passing in a variable current_line. Write out what current_line is equal to on each function call, and trace how it becomes line_count in print_a_line.

3. Find each place a function is used, and check its def to make sure that you are giving it the right arguments.

4. Research online what the seek function for file does. Try pydoc file, and see if you can figure it out from there. Then try pydoc file.seek to see what seek does.


5. Research the shorthand notation +=, and rewrite the script to use += instead
