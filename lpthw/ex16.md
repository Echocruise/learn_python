# exercise
1. 输入代码
```python
from sys import argv
script,filename = argv
print(f"We're going to erase {filename}.")#erase抹掉
print(f"If you don't want that, hit CTRL-c(^c).")
print("If you do want thar, hit RETURN.")

input("?")
print("Opening the file ...")

target = open(filename,'w')# 参数w为write的缩写
print("Truncating the file. Goodbye!")
target.truncate()#什么作用？Empties the file 清空整个文件的内容
print("Now I'm going ask you for three lines.")
line1 = input("line 1: ")
line2 = input("line 2: ")
line3 = input("line 3: ")
print("I'm going to write these to the file.")
target.write(line1)#分别写入三行
target.write("\n")#换行？
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")

print("And finally, we close it.")
target.close()## 关闭文件
```

# study drills
1. If you do not understand this, go back through and use the comment trick to get it squared away in your mind. One simple English comment above each line will help you understand or at least let you know what you need to research more.
  - 为每行注释
2. Write a script similar to the last exercise that uses read and argv to read the file you just created.
  -
3. There’s too much repetition in this file. Use strings, formats, and escapes to print out line1, line2, and line3 with just one target.write() command instead of six.
  -
4. Find out why we had to pass a 'w' as an extra parameter to open. Hint: open tries to be safe by making you explicitly say you want to write a file.
  -
5. If you open the file with 'w' mode, then do you really need the target.truncate()? Read the documentation for Python’s open function and see if that’s true
