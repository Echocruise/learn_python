1. 输入代码
```python
i = 0
numbers = []

while i < 6:
    print(f"At the top i is {i}")
    numbers.append(i)

    i +=1
    print("Number now:", numbers)

print("The numbers:")

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

1. Convert this while-loop to a function that you can call, and replace 6 in the test (i < 6) with a variable.
```python
def fun(n):
  i = 0
  numbers = []
  while i < n:
    print(f"At the top is {i}")
    i +=1
    print("Number now:", numbers)
  print("The numbers:")
  for num in numbers:
      print(num)
nu = int(input("Pleas input a number:"))
fun(nu)


```

2. Use this function to rewrite the script to try different numbers.


3. Add another variable to the function arguments that you can pass in that lets you change the + 1 on line 8 so you can change how much it increments by.

4. Rewrite the script again to use this function to see what effect that has.

5. Write it to use for-loops and range. Do you need the incrementor in the middle anymore? What happens if you do not get rid of it?
```python
nu = int(input("Pleas input a number:"))
def fun(n,inc):
  
```
